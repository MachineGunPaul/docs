**NB:** This document is still very much a work in progress and constantly evolving. Please read the notes below to find out how to contribute.

## Etymology

The word “adept” is derived from the Latin word *adeptus* which means “one who has attained”. Moreover an **adept** can be described as an individual that has attained a specific level of knowledge, skill or aptitude within a given field.

## What is Adept?

[Adept](https://adeptdao.org/) will be a platform that empowers digital creators to build their own decentralized communities. As opposed to existing [DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work) tooling platforms we will take a user-first approach providing users with all the necessary tools and components to build and manage their own community. 

We will make no assumptions of the user's prior background knowledge or experience with web3, blockchain or crypto. This is an imperative approach we have chosen to take in order to limit any potential barriers to entry for the everyday individual.
 
Our objective is to create an ecosystem where people that share the same passions, interests and goals can connect, collaborate and earn.

## Paradigm Shift

The world as we know it is changing, and recent global events have proven that some companies can operate just as or even more efficiently with remote personnel.

Due to the current global climate, we have also been witnessing more and more people leave their full-time employment in pursuit of work that is more meaningful, and flexible in terms of working hours. More than ever before people are striving for a more optimal work-life balance rather than pursuing opportunities that are more financially appealing.

Traditionally after obtaining a degree, people would seek employment within a company typically working in an area of expertise that was reflective of what they studied. They would then work from 9-5 for the next 40 years, slowly working their way up within an organization until retirement. This is the way in which it has been.

DAOs have the ability to fundamentally change the way in which people work and earn a living. The worker of tomorrow will be able to earn money by contributing to multiple DAOs, making use of their varied skill-set within a thriving ecosystem without borders and one that isn’t bound by time. This is the future of web3.
DAOs will give individuals the opportunity to pursue multiple careers simultaneously in such a way that has never been done before. For example, Tom is a member of a DAO, his primary skills are photography so he regularly submits photos as part of community bounty, in exchange he is rewarded in tokens for that community. He also has an interest in programming but he’s still very much a beginner. He joins another DAO where he is able to make micro contributions and is able to earn tokens for that DAO also. Tom is an avid copywriter and regularly contributes copy to two other DAOs. He is able to do all of this at his own choosing. He gets paid on time without disputes as all of this is governed by [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp).


## Technology

Adept will be built on top of [Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com/), a highly secure and infinitely scalable decentralized network. The core platform itself will be governed by a number of core modular components or smart contracts that will reside on the Radix network which will dictate every aspect that you would expect from a DAO such as voting, payment, access control and the creation of new DAOs that are derived from the platform itself. All these components will need to be architected and designed in a way that is scalable and maintainable.

## Why Join?

We plan on building for the internet of tomorrow so If any of the information presented here resonates with you, then you are most welcome in joining us in our efforts in building and designing the core platform. We are looking for individuals from all walks of life, mainly:

* Developers
* Designers
* Writers
* Architects
* Thinkers

We are currently a small community but feel free to join us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8s3SVVfKYz).
